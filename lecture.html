          <h1>Decade of 1950 </h1>
          <p>William Higinbotham, member of the Manhattan project, worked in the National Laboratory of Brookhaven.
 As a laboratory they were not conceived to entertain the public, so he had to think how to entertain the visitors from school trips or families.
In 1958 William modified an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope#:~:text=An%20oscilloscope%2C%20previously%20called%20an,usually%20as%20a%20calibrated%20two%2D">oscilloscope</a>
enabling that two people could send light to one edge of the screen to the other. This was one of the first videogame known as Tennis for two  or Computer tennis.
He could not imagine the future market of his invention, so he “destroyed” the game as the pieces where needed for other projects.

          <h1>Bertie the brain </h1>
          <p>  1950s Josef's Kates "Bertie the brain" was the first functional video game as prior attempts failed to work in computers because the code was to complex.
            Like Alan’s Turing 1948 chess game,"Turo champ", whose code was far to complex for the technology of the time.
  Bertie the brain is a simulation of the tic-tac-toe game.

          <h1>Other failed attempts </h1>
          <p> Some companies rejected to develop employees ideas such as Ralph’s Baer to manipulate TV images. He wait till 1966 to prove his idea when Sanders
  invested $20k on him. In the 60s more people started in to computers, some wanted to test their limitations and created new softwares to test the possibilities.
     Also, the interest started to raise around the world and we saw the creation of new companies, like SEGA in Japan.
